Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirhosseinmirzaie/diamonds-price-dataset
This project is at the heart of the "Algorithms and Machine Learning" course at IMT Atlantique (Nantes, France).
We have chosen to attempt to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting diamonds price.
Our main goal is to predict his price thanks to information such as weight, clarity, depth and other statistics.
This problem is a regression task that will use supervised machine learning and batch learning.
